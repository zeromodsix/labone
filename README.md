# Lab 1--Search Engine

**Status**: The project is nearing completion and the only thing left to do is sorting the files by index.

## Test the program

* Download the program `new.cpp`, and the file `/files`. Compile it in a Linux machine.
* To ease out the testing program, there is a shell script `combineall.sh`, which will copy contents of all the text files inside the `/files` directory to one text file `all.txt`. To test, if the output of the program is correct, open the file `all.txt` then use your text editor to do a search and cross-check if the counts match.
* Try to add large files. The following links may be used to get random paragraphs
