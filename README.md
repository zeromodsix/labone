# Lab 1--Search Engine

**Status**: The project is almost completed, it only remains to undergo the testing stage.
**Currently only supports English Alphabet, i.e., Unicode is unsupported**.

## Test the program

* Download the program `new.cpp`, and the file `/files`. Compile it in a Linux machine.
* To ease out the testing process, there is a shell script `combineall.sh` which will copy contents of all the text files inside the `/files` directory to a single text file `all.txt`. To test, whether the output of the program is correct, open the file `all.txt`. Then use your text editor to run a search and cross-check if the counts match. (*Optional*)
* **Try to add large files**, as long as they are text files (commas, periods and other special characters should pose no problem). The following links may be used to get random paragraphs
